        "MESSAGE_1": "At BikeMaps we love biking as much as we love maps! Our goal is to map your cycling experience to make biking safer. You know your local cycling trouble spots and we want you to map them. Your knowledge of cycling safety, hazards, and even bike thefts will be analyzed using GIS and statistics to identify hot spots of cycling safety, risk, and crime.  We are constantly updating our maps and technology, so send us feedback.  And stay tuned for updated safety maps generated from YOUR biking experience.",

        "Q1": "Why are you collecting this information?",
        "Q2": "What will you do with the data?",
        "Q3": "Will you be advising local municipalities of the hazards?",
        "Q4": "Where do you get the rider volume data?",
        "Q5": "Isnâ€™t Strava data only where recreational cyclists are riding?",
        "Q6": "How can I get involved?",
        "Q7": "I work for a municipality or city. How can we partner with BikeMaps?",
        "A1": "Only 30% (approximately) of bike collision data is collected and there is no centralized reporting system. We also have no information on near misses.",
        "A2": "The BikeMaps.org team is interested in analyzing the data to determine factors that influence cycling safety. We also have plans to build tools to help people plan safer routes and to transfer these to planners in your area.",
        "A3": "As more hazard data is logged, we intend to develop a system of alerting the various municipalities. The time sensitivity of hazards varies widely and we need to factor this in, for example broken glass versus a pothole.",
        "A4": "The data on where cyclists are riding has been provided by Strava.",
        "A5": "Stravalabs estimates that 40% of its rider data are commuter traffic, though this likely varies by region.",
        "A6": "You can share the website on social media, host a mapping demo night, or volunteer to do GIS or development. If you own a bike store or small business, you can advertise BikeMaps.org. We are also on the lookout for more research funding to further develop the technology and expand the study. Or, perhaps your group has GIS data that may improve BikeMaps.org.",
